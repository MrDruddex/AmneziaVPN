▎What is a VPN?

VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows you to create a secure connection between your device and the Internet. It encrypts your Internet traffic and hides your IP address, which provides a greater degree of anonymity and security online. VPNs are often used to protect personal data, bypass geographic restrictions, and access blocked resources.

▎Benefits of Using a VPN

1. Security: Data encryption protects your information from hackers and other intruders, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.

2. Anonymity: Hiding your IP address helps keep your privacy safe, since your ISP and other third parties cannot track your activity.

3. Bypass Geographical Restrictions: VPNs allow you to connect to servers in different countries, which allows you to access content that may not be available in your region.

4. Censorship Protection: In countries with strict internet censorship, a VPN can help you bypass blocks and access the information you need.
